# EnglishAI

The OpenAI-powered English helper

EnglishAI was a software that I developed in April 2022 that allowed users to perform actions relating to analyzing English texts, using the OpenAI DaVinci API to communicate through a repl.it PHP backend server. This service is no longer maintained or functional. The backend has been fully shut down and the capabilities/reliability of EnglishAI were limited in comparison to newer AI models available nowadays such as GPT and Bard.

EnglishAI allowed users to input a literary title and instruct the AI to create a thesis for it, summarize it, or find figurative language. It also allowed users to create analysis comparisons between two literary works.

This repo is simply for archival purposes and to remember what the less-known AIs were like before the rise of ChatGPT. :)


(Also the code is pretty bad and not optimized at all. Please don't judge, this interface took like 20 mins)
